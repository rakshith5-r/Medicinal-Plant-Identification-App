This project aims to address the need for efficient and standardized methods for identifying medicinal plants. Traditional identification methods can be unreliable, so an automatic identification system based on leaf features such as shape, color, and texture is proposed. A database of scanned images of medicinal plant leaves will be used to create a classification system based on shape and dimension combination. The benefits of this system include helping communities to develop their knowledge of medicinal plants, enabling taxonomists to develop more efficient species identification techniques, and contributing significantly to pharmaceutical drug manufacturing. Overall, this project provides a reliable and efficient system for identifying medicinal plants based on their leaf features, fulfilling an important need in the industry.
